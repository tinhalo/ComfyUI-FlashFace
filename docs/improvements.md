# ComfyUI-FlashFace Improvements

This document summarizes the recent improvements and refactoring done to the ComfyUI-FlashFace extension.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Robust Model Loading System

We've completely refactored the model loading system to be more robust and user-friendly:

- Added a centralized model registry for managing model files
- Implemented automatic downloading of models from HuggingFace
- Added MD5 checksum verification to ensure file integrity
- Created a robust path resolution system that works across different ComfyUI installations

### 2. SafeTensors Support

All model loading now supports the SafeTensors format, which provides:

- Enhanced security by preventing execution of malicious code in model files
- Faster loading times, especially for large models
- Improved memory efficiency

### 3. Improved Error Handling

The extension now has much better error handling:

- Informative error messages when models are missing
- Graceful fallback to legacy paths if model registry fails
- Proper exception handling for different failure scenarios

### 4. Installation Simplification

The installation process is now much simpler:

- Models are downloaded automatically when needed
- No need to manually download and place model files
- Better directory structure to support different ComfyUI configurations

### 5. Developer-Friendly Architecture

The code has been restructured to be more maintainable:

- Clear separation of concerns between components
- Well-documented utilities for model management
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Migration Notes

If you're upgrading from a previous version:

1. Your existing models will continue to work
2. New installations will automatically download models as needed
3. The UI now selects models by name rather than by filename
