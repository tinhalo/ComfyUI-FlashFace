# Technical Documentation for ComfyUI-FlashFace

This document provides technical details about the ComfyUI-FlashFace extension, including architecture, components, and developer information.

## Architecture Overview

The extension is organized into several key components:

1. **Nodes**: ComfyUI integration nodes for the user interface
2. **Models**: Core deep learning models for face detection and generation
3. **Operations**: Diffusion and other operations
4. **Utilities**: Helper functions for model loading, caching, etc.

## Key Components

### Node Components

- `flashface_loadmodel.py`: Loads and initializes the FlashFace model
- `flashface_detectface.py`: Face detection and cropping using RetinaFace
- `flashface_generator.py`: Generates personalized faces using the FlashFace model
- `flashface_cliptextencode.py`: Encodes text prompts using CLIP

### Model Registry

The new model registry system (`flashface/models/model_registry.py`) manages model files with:

- Centralized registry of available models with metadata
- Automatic download capabilities with MD5 verification
- Robust path resolution for different installation configurations

```python
# Example of registering a model
MODEL_REGISTRY = {
    "model_name": {
        "url": "https://example.com/model.safetensors",
        "md5": "checksum_hash_here",
        "filename": "model_name.safetensors",
        "description": "Model description"
    }
}
```

### Cache Management

The caching system (`flashface/utils/cache_utils.py`) provides:

- Efficient downloading with progress indicators
- MD5 checksum verification
- File existence checking and management

### SafeTensors Loading

The model loading utilities support SafeTensors format through:

- Unified loading interface that works with both .pth and .safetensors formats
- Proper error handling for missing files
- Device mapping for model weights

## Developer Guide

### Adding New Models

To add a new model to the registry:

1. Update the `MODEL_REGISTRY` dictionary in `flashface/models/model_registry.py`
2. Provide the URL, MD5 checksum, filename, and description
3. Use `get_model_path()` in your code to retrieve the model path

Example:
```python
from flashface.models.model_registry import get_model_path

model_path = get_model_path('model_name', auto_download=True)
```

### Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:

- Graceful fallback to legacy paths if model registry fails
- Informative error messages for missing models
- MD5 verification to detect corrupted downloads

### Extending the System

To add new functionality:

1. Add new models to the registry following the pattern
2. Implement new nodes in the `nodes/` directory
3. Update the cache utilities if needed for special download requirements

## Testing

When making changes, test the following scenarios:

1. Fresh installation with no models (should trigger auto-download)
2. Installation with existing models (should use existing files)
3. Corrupted model files (should re-download with correct checksums)
4. Different ComfyUI installation configurations

## Contributing

When contributing to this extension:

1. Follow the existing code style and architecture
2. Update documentation to reflect your changes
3. Add appropriate error handling for robustness
4. Test thoroughly across different environments
